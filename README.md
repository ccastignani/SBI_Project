# Tutorial

## Prerequisites

* <b>Python</b> 3.0 Release

https://www.python.org/download/releases/3.0/

* <b>Modeller</b> 9.19 Release

https://anaconda.org/salilab/modeller

It is also recommended to have a program for interactive visualization and analysis of molecular structures and related data, such as <b>Chimera</b> or <b>VMD</b>.

## Input files

The input files must be <b>pairs of interacting chains</b> (.pdb), which has to be located into a directory decided by the user. This directory can also be in <i>tar.gz</i> format. 

In case you are interested in <b>rebuilding a macrocomplex</b>, you can introduce its <b>pdb file</b> (.pdb) from PDB."

## Python modules

A module is a file containing Python definitions and statements. It is important to consider that definitions from a module can be imported into other modules or into the <i>main</i> module.

* <b>sbi_project.py</b>: <i>main</i> module or program created to reconstruct a macrocomplex given a set of interacting pairs (prot-prot, prot-RNA). It also considers the possibility to rebuild a macrocomplex if the input is a macrocomplex (.pdb). 

Aditionally, this module contains the ArgumentParser object, created using argparse module, which is used for command-line options, arguments and sub-commands. The ArgumentParser object will hold all the information necessary to parse the command line into Python data types.

* <b>get_interactions.py</b>: this module is <b>only</b> used by the <i>main</i> module if the given input is a macrocomplex (.pdb). It gets all possible interactions given a this structure and computes the distance between chains parining that ones which accomplish the following conditions: less than 8A between their carbons alpha (CA) and implication of at least 8 CA in this interaction. It creates the pair files (.pdb) which later, in the <i>main</i> program will be filtered by the imported module named <b>reduce_inputs_func.py</b> to get only the non-redundant interactions to build the model.

* <b>reduce_inputs_func.py</b>: this module is imported into the <i>main</i> module to speeds up the further process to create the model, as it is getting only the non-redundant interactions from the whole set of input pairs. From a set of input pairs (.pdb) compares each chain pair with the rest. This comparision has two steps: sequence and structural. First of all, a pairwise alignment is performed to determine similar sequences (cut-off = 0.9). The score of the alignment is normalized by the length of the longest sequence. If the normalized score is higher than the stablished cut-off, the analysis proceeds to the second step. In this step, a superimposition is performed between the similar chains. These similar chains are part of two different interaction pairs, which will be refered as fixed and moving chains. We apply the rotran matrix to the couple of the moving chain, which will be refered as alternative/new chain. Finally, the distances between the CA of the comparing chain (couple of the fixed chain) and the new chain are computed. If the distance is lower than 9A, the interactions will be considered the same (redundant). It saves the non-redundant chain pairs (.pdb) obtained from the reducing inputs process, which will be considered as the required input pairs to build the model.

* <b>functions.py</b>: this module is composed by a set of different <b>functions</b> to solve biological and technical problems during the analysis. Thus, it is imported into the other modules in order to use the defined functions.

* <b>utilities.py</b>: this module is composed by a set of different <b>variables</b> to solve biological and technical problems during the analysis. Thus, it is imported into the other modules in order to use the defined functions.

* <b>classes.py</b>: this module is composed by the definition of a <b>class</b> to check if the input variable is a directory or a compressed directory (.tar.gz).

* <b>DOPE_profile.py</b>: this module is <b>only</b> used if the argument '-e', '--energy_plot' is set. It creates a DOPE profile plot (.jpg) from a macrocomplex (.pdb), which has no acid nucleic chains using Modeller.

* <b>DOPE_comparison.py</b>: this module is <b>only</b> used if the argument '-ref', '--refine' is set. It refines a model previously generated with the <i>main</i> program according to the optimization parameters defined by Modeller. It also generates a comparison energy plot between the model generated by the program and the refined one.
